This is Repository that I am maintaing, to keep track of all that I have learned 
in Apache Airflow.

I have started with a Udemy course The Complete Hands-On Introduction to Apache Airflow by Marc Lamberti (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-hands-on-course-to-master-apache-airflow/)

I am only mainting the code here and will leave necessary information on what the code does and if there are any pre-requisites required for the same.
The theoretical knowledege can be obtained from various online resources, but personally I am referring the official online documentation https://airflow.apache.org/docs/

Pre-requisites:

1: Download the Airflow VM instance from the course material and and set it up using program like Virtual box.
   The username and password for the same is "airflow"

2: We will use Virtial Studio code editor to connect with the instance in our local system to the Airflow instance.
